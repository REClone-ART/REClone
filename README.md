# üß¨ REClone: Reverse-Engineering the RE Engine

> A community-driven effort to analyze, document, and replicate the core systems of Capcom‚Äôs RE Engine ‚Äî from RSZ serialization to ECS, Lua scripting, and scene composition.

---

## üìå What is REClone?

**REClone** is a reverse-engineering initiative and prototype framework inspired by the architecture of Capcom's RE Engine. Our goal is to build a modular, open-source clone of the RE Engine's runtime systems for education, tooling, and experimentation.

---

## üß† Core Concept: RSZ Reflection is the Heart

RE Engine is a **metadata-driven architecture** built on RSZ (Reflection Serialization). Every object, component, and asset is defined and processed via RSZ metadata types. Understanding and replicating RSZ is the cornerstone of this project.

## üî¨ Reverse Engineering Plan

### Phase 1: Foundational Research

#### ‚úÖ RSZ Serialization

* Dump all RSZ types via REFramework:

  ```lua
  for name, type in pairs(re.manager:get_types()) do
      log.info(string.format("%s (Size: 0x%X)", name, type:get_size()))
  end
  ```
* Use `RszTool`, `.natives` dumps, and 010 Editor templates to analyze `.scn`, `.pfb`, `.mesh`, `.mdf2` formats.

#### ‚úÖ Subsystem Mapping

| Subsystem   | Hook Target          | Tools                     |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Entity Init | `Entity.create()`    | REFramework, Cheat Engine |
| File Access | `FileSystem.open()`  | RETool, ProcMon           |
| Lua         | `LuaState.execute()` | REFramework Lua Hooks     |

---

### Phase 2: RECloneCore Prototype

#### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Type System Kernel

```cpp
class RSZType {
public:
    std::string name;
    uint32_t size;
    std::map<std::string, uint16_t> fields;
};
std::vector<RSZType> g_typeDB;
```

#### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Entity-Component System (ECS)

```cpp
class Entity {
    std::vector<std::shared_ptr<Component>> components;
    void add_component(uint32_t type_id);
};
```

#### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Asset Loading

* Parse `.mesh`, `.mdf2`, `.tex` using custom tools or convert via Noesis plugins.

#### ‚ú≥Ô∏è Lua Scripting

```lua
function Entity:update()
    if self:get("Transform").position.y < 0 then
        self:destroy()
    end
end
```

### Phase 3: Tool-Driven Validation

| Goal               | Tool                      | Validation         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------ |
| RSZ Field Accuracy | RszTool, REFramework      | > 95% field match  |
| Scene Load         | `.pfb` preview in REClone | Correct transforms |
| Lua Behavior       | Script tests              | Pathfinding & AI   |

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* C++17 compiler
* LuaJIT or Sol2
* Python 3.10+ (for tooling)
* Noesis (for asset inspection)
* REFramework installed on RE Engine game

### Build Instructions (Coming Soon)
