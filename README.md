# REClone
REClone is an open-source, metadata-driven reimplementation of Capcom’s proprietary RE Engine (used in Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, etc). Our goal is to reverse-engineer the engine’s architecture and rebuild a minimal, working clone using reflection-based serialization (RSZ), ECS, Lua scripting, and asset pipelines.
