# ðŸŽ® REClone â€“ Reverse-Engineering Capcom's RE Engine

**REClone** is an open-source, metadata-driven reimplementation of Capcomâ€™s proprietary RE Engine (used in Resident Evil, Devil May Cry, Monster Hunter, etc). Our goal is to reverse-engineer the engineâ€™s architecture and rebuild a minimal, working clone using reflection-based serialization (RSZ), ECS, Lua scripting, and asset pipelines.

> ðŸ§  Powered by reverse-engineered data, modding tools, and REFramework introspection.
